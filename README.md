# Velocimeter

Velocimeter frontend is inspired by Original Solidly v1 frontend. However, everything is refactored to use typescript in strict mode. It also introduces Tailwind CSS for styling. Some of the legacy components can be found under the legacy folder.
We also have many-many more fixes and improvements.

## 🏎️ &nbsp; Quickstart

Velocimeter relies on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/), [VIEM](viem.sh), [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/), [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction) and [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
It also uses Web3-React and FLUX.

## 💻 &nbsp; Developer Experience
